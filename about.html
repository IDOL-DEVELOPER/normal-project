                        opportunities to apply what they have learned. Through these practical exercises, students gain
                        valuable experience in building websites, creating web applications, and solving real-world
                        development challenges.

                        development.

                        We understand the importance of career readiness, and that's why we provide placement assistance
                        to our students. Our strong network of industry connections and partnerships enables us to
                        connect graduates with internship opportunities and job placements in leading companies.
